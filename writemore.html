<h1 id="reasons-why-i-should-write-more">8 Reasons Why I Should Write
More</h1>
<p><strong>Date: 30/12/2025</strong></p>
<h2 id="i-think-therefore-i-should-write">1.  I think, therefore I
should write</h2>
<p>I’ve really loved to deeply think about things since my childhood.
This urge even pushed me to consider about changing my major from
mathematics to philosophy in my first year. I like to read and think but
there’s a missing part on this picture: I rarely write.</p>
<p>I want to record my thoughts on things I like to think about deeply,
to leave a mark. I believe that writing makes people eternal. I would
love for my friends and family members, and people from other part of
the world, to be able to read my writings. They don’t have to but they
should be able to read them.</p>
<h2 id="time-capsule">2. Time Capsule</h2>
<p>Reading something you wrote in the past is a unique experience. It’s
like a reading history book where you are the main character. I’d like
to say “what a dumbf*ck you are” to my younger self five years later.
Being able to observe your cognitive journey during a specific period of
your life should be very cool, too.</p>
<h2 id="scientific-findings">3.  Scientific Findings</h2>
<p>There are dozens of studies on how writings helps people from
different perspectives, such as emotional well being and
self-expression. I have encountered almost only positive findings about
writings. Hence I believe writing is definetely good thing for a
humanbeing, like doing exercises.</p>
<h2 id="everything-that-can-be-said-can-be-said-clearly">4. Everything
that can be said, can be said clearly</h2>
<p>One should be able to express themselves clearly if they want to have
positive relationships in their life. Conflicts usually occur due to
misunderstanding. This can happen for two separate reasons: one side
cannot understand or does not want to understand. In this case, there’s
nothing to do.</p>
<p>However, the other side can reduce misunderstanding by expressing
themselves clearly. This would reduce conflicts, and fewer toxic
conflicts mean healthier relationships between individuals and
societies. Thus, I want to be able to clearly express myself to have
fewer toxic conflicts. It’s also very cool to express yourself clearly,
not everyone is able to do it.</p>
<h2 id="i-like-writing">5. I like writing</h2>
<p>This is probably the most important thing when one wants to start or
do anything in this world. At the beginning, like any other creative
processes, it is diffucult. A dull blank screen or page staring at you
makes you feel scared to fill it. You think this is a very tedious thing
to do.</p>
<p>That feeling is beautifully explained by a very famous painter.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<i> You don’t know how paralyzing it is, that stare from a blank canvas
that says to the painter you can’t do anything. The canvas has an
idiotic stare, and mesmerizes some painters so that they turn into
idiots themselves. <br> <br> Many painters are afraid of the blank
canvas, but the blank canvas IS AFRAID of the truly passionate painter
who dares — and who has once broken the spell of “you can’t.” <br>
-Vincent Van Gogh </i>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Once you start to writing, it grows word by word like a plant growing
and you get the satisfaction from it, just like watching the plant grow,
since producing is an inevitable element of human satisfaction.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-cool-people-did-write">6. All the cool people did
write</h2>
<p>Da Vinci, Platon, Ludwig Wittgeinstein, Fermat so on. Did they know
that their writings would be studied centuries after their deaths? I
don’t think so. There’s clearly a reason for this common behaviour.
Scientiest might have studied this issue, but from my perspecive, it is
sensible to assume writing helps you to become cool.</p>
<h2 id="world-building">7. World Building</h2>
<p>I want to build a world. This definetely requieres a lot of
writings.</p>
<h2 id="bingo">8. Bingo</h2>
<p>I added “write 20+ short story/essay” to my 2026 Bingo. I should
write to fulfill it.</p>
