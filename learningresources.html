<h1 id="learning-path-resources">Learning Path &amp; Resources</h1>
<p>I’m neither an expert nor a teacher, but I enjoy learning. The
following materials are the result of my research and learning path. I
want to excel in computers in general, but specifically in game engine
programming. I have some background in programming and mathematics.
Right now, I’m focused on Data Structures &amp; Algorithms and computer
architecture/operating systems. I am following these resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[Video] <a href="https://guide.handmadehero.org/">Handmade
Hero</a>: This is a very long series (600+ episodes each 1h+ long) about
making a video game from scratch. I mean literally from scratch. No game
engine, no graphics API, no library. It’s not finished yet, but it is a
well-appreciated series—not only for game development but also for
understanding computers in general. According to Ryan Fleury (a
well-known programmer) and others who followed the series, the first
30–40 episodes are enough to get a solid grasp of computer fundamentals.
There’s also a well-organized YouTube channel where you can browse
episodes by topic.</p>

<li><p>[Book] Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena</p></li>
<li><p>[Book] Computer Systems - A Programmer’s Perspective by Randal E.
Bryant &amp; David R. O’Hallaron</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not strictly following books, but I enjoy reading them. I use
them both as a guide and as learning material. I usually search on the
internet until I feel fully understood the topic. I watch youtube
videos, read blogposts etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Book / Blog] <a
href="https://learnopengl.com/">learnopengl.com</a>: Video games are
mostly about rendering, unless you’re making a text-based game. This is
an excellent, easy-to-understand graphics programming course from my
perspective.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-resources">Other Resources</h2>
<p>These are the resources I come across on the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250422200559/https://engine-programming.github.io/">Learn
Game Engine Programming</a>: This is another great and well-structured
collection of resources for learning engine programming. Unfortunately,
the original website is gone, but luckily, we have an Internet-archived
version.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://learncpp.com">learncpp.com</a>: Can be used for
either learning or manual material.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">Nand2tetris</a>: This is a
course about building computer from scratch. It gives good insights
about how computers actually work.</p></li>
